We are still working on the logistics, but we anticipate each meal to cost around $30 per person.
Please fill the lunch section in the registration form.

Neither breakfast nor dinner will be provided.

## Transportation

Larkspur offers local shuttle.
Reservation on-site is required and the shuttle is based on availability.

Public transportation between the hotels listed above and the SETI institute is inconvenient.
The bus schedule is limited, unreliable, and the commute involves at least a 30 minute walk to the bus stop from either Sonesta or Larkspur.
Routes can be planned via Google Maps, attendees are encouraged to check the bus (lines 21 & 523) schedule closer to the meeting.

We encourage the conference attendees to rent a car and/or coordinate with others who will do so.
The attendees are free to park at the SETI carpark.
Both Uber and Lyft operate in the area and are convenient.
