Lunch options are very limited close to SETI facilities.
Therefore, on-site lunch will be arranged for interested participants.
We are still working on the logistics, but we anticipate each meal to cost around $30 per person.
Please fill the lunch section in the registration form.

Neither breakfast nor dinner will be provided.

## Transportation

Larkspur and Sonesta offer local shuttle. Reservation on-site is required and the shuttle is based on availability.

Public transportation between certain hotels in the area and the SETI institute is inconvenient. The bus schedule is limited and can be unreliable. Guests staying in hotels at N Mathilda Ave in Sunnyvale can take the bus line 21 from Maude & Matilda to Logue & Matilda and then walk ca. 20 minutes to the SETI institute. Routes can be planned via Google Maps, attendees are encouraged to check the schedules (buses 21, 523, Orange Line) closer to the meeting.

We encourage the conference attendees to rent a car and/or coordinate with others who will do so.
The attendees are free to park at the SETI carpark.
Both Uber and Lyft operate in the area and are convenient.
