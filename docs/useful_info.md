## Hotels

We will not book accommodation for participants. Conference attendees are free to choose from a variety of hotels or motels located close to the conference venue, many of which are located on the N Mathilda Ave in Sunnyvale. Facilities commonly used by SETI visitors include:

* [Sonesta ES Suites Sunnyvale – 900 Hamlin Ct, Sunnyvale, CA 94089](https://www.sonesta.com/sonesta-es-suites/ca/sunnyvale/sonesta-es-suites-sunnyvale)

SETI institute has a negotiated rate with Sonesta, currently at $169 + tax/fees for a single suite and $199 for a double suite. Participants will receive a booking code upon request.

Rates start at $232 + tax/fees for a single queen bed room.

Please note that 3rd party retailers might offer different rates for these options. The rates might also increase by fall.

## Food

Lunch options are very limited close to SETI facilities. Therefore, on-site lunch will be arranged for interested participants. We are still working on the logistics, but we anticipate each meal to cost around $30 per person. Please fill the form in the registration. Neither breakfast nor dinner will be provided.

## Transportation

Larkspur offers local shuttle. Reservation on-site is required and the shuttle is based on availability.

Public transportation between the hotels listed above and the SETI institute is inconvenient. The bus schedule is limited, unreliable, and the commute involves at least a 30 minute walk to the bus stop from either Sonesta or Larkspur. Routes can be planned via Google Maps, attendees are encouraged to check the bus (lines 21 & 523) schedule closer to the meeting.

We encourage the conference attendees to rent a car and/or coordinate with others who will do so. The attendees are free to park at the SETI carpark. Both Uber and Lyft operate in the area and are convenient.
