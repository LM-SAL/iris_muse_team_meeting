# Joint MUSE/IRIS science team meeting, October 27-30 2025

!!! Notice

    The upcoming Joint IRIS / MUSE Science Team Meeting is mission-critical.
    It brings together modelers, observers, and inversion experts to rigorously test and improve the fidelity of our tools, observing programs (including coordinated programs with facilities such as the GBO), instrumental decisions, and disambiguation techniques.
    Because many scientific inferences rest on how closely models reproduce reality, it is essential to benchmark and refine them against observations.
    By pushing model‚Äêdata comparisons in a structured forum, the meeting helps expose weaknesses, surface missing physics, optimize observational configurations, and chart the path toward more robust, reliable numerical models that can reliably underpin future IRIS/MUSE science.

Our current understanding of the solar chromosphere, transition region, and corona is rapidly evolving, fueled by increasingly advanced simulations of the coupled solar atmosphere and unprecedented high-resolution observations from ground-based (e.g., SST, DKIST) and space-based (e.g., IRIS, Solar Orbiter/EUI) telescopes.

The purpose of this meeting is to support the operations of IRIS and MUSE by providing realistic numerical simulations that can be used to assist with the science planning, data calibration, and data pipeline aspects of the IRIS and MUSE missions. The goal is to improve existing models of the dominant processes driving solar dynamics and heating and to develop new models, through rigorous comparisons between simulations and observations.

This joint team meeting provides a dynamic forum for critical comparison, highlighting recent breakthroughs, identifying missing physics, and charting paths toward more realistic simulations, with particular attention to IRIS and the upcoming MUSE mission.
