Our current understanding of the solar chromosphere, transition region, and corona is rapidly evolving, fueled by increasingly advanced simulations of the coupled solar atmosphere and unprecedented high-resolution observations from ground-based (e.g., SST, DKIST) and space-based (e.g., IRIS, Solar Orbiter/EUI) telescopes.

The purpose of this meeting is to advance our knowledge of the dominant processes driving solar dynamics and heating—and to develop next-generation models—it is essential to rigorously compare simulations with observations, focusing on resolving discrepancies between observed and synthetic spectra.

This joint team meeting provides a dynamic forum for critical comparison, highlighting recent breakthroughs, identifying missing physics, and charting paths toward more realistic simulations, with particular attention to IRIS and the upcoming MUSE mission.
