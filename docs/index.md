# Joint MUSE/IRIS science team meeting, October 27-30 2025

Our current understanding of the solar chromosphere, transition region, and corona is rapidly evolving, fueled by increasingly advanced simulations of the coupled solar atmosphere and unprecedented high-resolution observations from ground-based (e.g., SST, DKIST) and space-based (e.g., IRIS, Solar Orbiter/EUI) telescopes.

The purpose of this meeting is to support the operations of IRIS and MUSE by providing realistic numerical simulations that can be used to assist with the science planning, data calibration, and data pipeline aspects of the IRIS and MUSE missions. The goal is to improve existing models of the dominant processes driving solar dynamics and heating and to develop new models, through rigorous comparisons between simulations and observations.

This joint team meeting provides a dynamic forum for critical comparison, highlighting recent breakthroughs, identifying missing physics, and charting paths toward more realistic simulations, with particular attention to IRIS and the upcoming MUSE mission.
