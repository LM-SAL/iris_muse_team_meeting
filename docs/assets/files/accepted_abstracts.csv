Rebecca,Robinson,A mission-embedded outreach program for NASA's Multi-slit Solar Explorer (MUSE) mission: Inspiring future generations of solar explorers beyond boundaries and backgrounds,,"In the wake of the Decadal Survey for Solar and Space Physics, it has become abundantly clear that general knowledge of these subjects in the US is absent in comparison to other subfields of astrophysics. This is an alarming deficiency because we rely on the Sun to survive, and understanding our immediate space environment is crucial for understanding our relationship with the Sun. With that, it is our responsibility as scientists and educators to advocate for and share the knowledge of our Sun and space environments as accessibly as possible. One way to do so is by developing mission-specific outreach programs that tackle fundamental science questions and topics that are relevant to the Sun-Earth system. As a new and budding example, we introduce the new outreach program for NASA's Multi-slit Solar Explorer (MUSE) mission. This program officially began on December 1, 2024 and includes three main local partners: California Academy of Sciences, Chabot Space and Science Center, and the Boys & Girls Club of the Peninsula. Each partner's scope of work is shaped by their resources and expertise, and each remains committed to creating reusable and versatile outreach products. This talk will summarize the scientific goals of the MUSE mission, detail the MUSE outreach program, highlight our collaborations with other heliophysics missions (e.g. PUNCH), and provide a preliminary assessment of our contribution to the future of heliophysics outreach."
Juan,Martínez-Sykora,"Probing the Thermal Farley-Buneman Instability in the Chromosphere: New Insights, Limits on Single Fluid Assumptions, Constraints, and Broader Implications.","Sam Evans, Meers Oppenheimer, Yakov Dimant, Bart De Pontieu, Mats Carlsson","Understanding the chromospheric energy balance is critical, as it forms the interface between the cooler solar surface and the multi-million-degree corona. However, radiative MHD models often fail to reproduce key chromospheric observables—especially in active regions like plage—pointing to missing physics. One compelling candidate is the Thermal Farley-Buneman Instability (TFBI). Recent advances in linear theory reveal where large-scale 3D MHD models break down, particularly where the single-fluid approximation no longer holds. This theory shows that TFBI can grow under typical chromospheric conditions—across realistic ranges of density, temperature, magnetic field, and ionization fraction. We validate this instability using a suite of models, including multi-fluid 2D, kinetic 2D, and 3D simulations. Our preliminary analysis, combining our results with IRIS observations, reveals strong non-thermal broadening in the optically thin O I line between flux concentrations in plage, which is consistent with TFBI. Together, these results indicate that TFBI can drive meter-scale turbulence in the chromosphere, leading to localized heating and electric field restructuring—providing a promising path to understanding chromospheric turbulence and heating."
Daniel,Nóbrega-Siverio,Deciphering solar coronal heating: 3D reconnection in Coronal Bright Points.,TBD,"Coronal Bright Points (CBPs) are fundamental building blocks of the solar atmosphere. These ubiquitous brightenings, typically spanning 5-40 Mm, consist of compact, hot loops that shine in X-rays and EUV for hours to days. CBPs are also known sources of dynamic events such as coronal jets and small-scale filament eruptions. In this talk, we present a novel 3D radiative-MHD model that successfully reproduces the main observational characteristics of CBPs, including their sustained heating. We perform an in-depth analysis of three-dimensional magnetic reconnection processes within the CBP, focusing on braiding-induced reconnection at loop footpoints, interchange reconnection associated with the null point, and slipping reconnection along quasi-separatrix layers. In addition, we link these reconnection modes with their expected observational signatures, providing synthetic EUV diagnostics to facilitate direct comparisons with instruments such as SDO/AIA, Solar Orbiter/EUI, and the upcoming MUSE and Solar-C missions."
Åke,Nordlund,"Overview of Whole-Sun modeling project, including DISPATCH","Andrius Popovas, Mikolaj Szydlarski","I will give an overview of the ongoing modeling efforts in the ERC/SYG Whole Sun project, focusing mainly on the DYABLO and DISPATCH code developments, which aim to indeed model the whole Sun.  The DISPATCH development has reached a state where it is possible to model the entire solar convection zone, going arbitrarily close to the surface -- and indeed optionally include photospheric, chromospheric, and coronal physics.  The strategy and intent is to apply a ""zoom in"" methodology, where one starts with a large extent in model space time, with necessarily limited spatial resolution, and then zooms in to specific spatial and temporal regions of interest, allowing the modeling there to be based on initial and boundary conditions available from the larger extent model.  One could then, for example, model the dynamics of flux emergence on the scale of a solar active region, and focus on how the emerging flux interacts with the surface layers, without being forced to adapt arbitrary and parametrized initial and boundary conditions.   As part of the zoom-in modeling one can choose to include more physical detail, for example physics modules that were previously developed in the context of the BIFROST code.   A particle-in-cell solver that connects smoothly to an MHD solver in which it is embedded has also been developed, allowing studies of non-thermal particle acceleration in realistic settings. As part of the Whole Sun team efforts, a benchmark setup that contains the main ingredients and challenges of the sharp transition at the solar continuum surface was also developed.   This may be of interest to other modelers as well, who are welcome to a copy of the generic benchmark setup and procedures."
Abhishekh Kumar,Srivastava,Overview of the Symbiosis of Waves and Reconnection as a Source for Coronal Heating,"Eric R. Priest, Sripan Mondal, David I. Pontin","Symbiosis of Waves and Reconnection (SWAR) refers to the interconnection of waves and magnetic reconnection processes whereby each can mutually trigger each other. External wave-like perturbations can trigger or facilitate reconnection, whereas, on the other hand, reconnection can also generate waves. This interplay can lead to localized heating and dynamics in the solar atmosphere, such as coronal heating and the generation of the  solar wind. We will review and present some of our MHD models to describe the physics of this process, and its significance. Some preliminary observations will also be presented. In particular, MUSE will be invaluable in highlighting the observational effects of this combination of waves and reconnection. Furthermore, these fundamental physical processes are likely to occur over a wide range of  spatial and temporal scales, thus indicating the broader applicability of  dynamics and heating in a wide range of plasma environments."
Carlos Jose,Diaz Baso,How machine learning and inversion techniques can advance our understanding of the low solar atmosphere?,TBD,"In the last decade, machine learning and neural networks have emerged as powerful tools for extracting and analyzing relevant information from huge collections. They have demonstrated their versatility in data preprocessing, automatic segmentation of solar features, image deconvolution and reconstruction, acceleration of spectropolarimetric inversion techniques and prediction of explosive phenomena. This contribution will focus on how these advanced techniques, can be leveraged to maximize the scientific return from missions like MUSE and IRIS. We will review pioneering applications that directly support the operations and enhance the data products of these missions. We will describe the methodologies, discuss current challenges, and offer a perspective for future research that integrates these powerful tools with ongoing and future observational capabilities."
