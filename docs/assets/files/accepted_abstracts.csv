Juan,Martínez-Sykora,"Probing the Thermal Farley–Buneman Instability in the Chromosphere: New Insights, Limits on Single Fluid Assumptions, Constraints, and Broader Implications.","Sam Evans, Meers Oppenheimer, Yakov Dimant, Bart De Pontieu, Mats Carlsson","Understanding the chromospheric energy balance is critical, as it forms the interface between the cooler solar surface and the multi-million-degree corona. However, radiative MHD models often fail to reproduce key chromospheric observables—especially in active regions like plage—pointing to missing physics. One compelling candidate is the Thermal Farley–Buneman Instability (TFBI). Recent advances in linear theory reveal where large-scale 3D MHD models break down, particularly where the single-fluid approximation no longer holds. This theory shows that TFBI can grow under typical chromospheric conditions—across realistic ranges of density, temperature, magnetic field, and ionization fraction.
We validate this instability using a suite of models, including multi-fluid 2D, kinetic 2D, and 3D simulations. Our preliminary analysis, combining our results with IRIS observations, reveals strong non-thermal broadening in the optically thin O I line between flux concentrations in plage, which is consistent with TFBI. Together, these results indicate that TFBI can drive meter-scale turbulence in the chromosphere, leading to localized heating and electric field restructuring—providing a promising path to understanding chromospheric turbulence and heating.",TBD,Invited talk,Chromosphere
Daniel,Nóbrega-Siverio,Deciphering solar coronal heating: 3D reconnection in Coronal Bright Points.,TBD,"Coronal Bright Points (CBPs) are fundamental building blocks of the solar atmosphere. These ubiquitous brightenings, typically spanning 5–40 Mm, consist of compact, hot loops that shine in X-rays and EUV for hours to days. CBPs are also known sources of dynamic events such as coronal jets and small-scale filament eruptions.

In this talk, we present a novel 3D radiative-MHD model that successfully reproduces the main observational characteristics of CBPs, including their sustained heating. We perform an in-depth analysis of three-dimensional magnetic reconnection processes within the CBP, focusing on braiding-induced reconnection at loop footpoints, interchange reconnection associated with the null point, and slipping reconnection along quasi-separatrix layers.

In addition, we link these reconnection modes with their expected observational signatures, providing synthetic EUV diagnostics to facilitate direct comparisons with instruments such as SDO/AIA, Solar Orbiter/EUI, and the upcoming MUSE and Solar-C missions.",TBD,Invited talk,MUSE specific
Rebecca,Robinson,A mission-embedded outreach program for NASA’s Multi-slit Solar Explorer (MUSE) mission: Inspiring future generations of solar explorers beyond boundaries and backgrounds,,"In the wake of the Decadal Survey for Solar and Space Physics, it has become abundantly clear that general knowledge of these subjects in the US is absent in comparison to other subfields of astrophysics. This is an alarming deficiency because we rely on the Sun to survive, and understanding our immediate space environment is crucial for understanding our relationship with the Sun. With that, it is our responsibility as scientists and educators to advocate for and share the knowledge of our Sun and space environments as accessibly as possible. One way to do so is by developing mission-specific outreach programs that tackle fundamental science questions and topics that are relevant to the Sun-Earth system. As a new and budding example, we introduce the new outreach program for NASA's Multi-slit Solar Explorer (MUSE) mission. This program officially began on December 1, 2024 and includes three main local partners: California Academy of Sciences, Chabot Space and Science Center, and the Boys & Girls Club of the Peninsula. Each partner's scope of work is shaped by their resources and expertise, and each remains committed to creating reusable and versatile outreach products. This talk will summarize the scientific goals of the MUSE mission, detail the MUSE outreach program, highlight our collaborations with other heliophysics missions (e.g. PUNCH), and provide a preliminary assessment of our contribution to the future of heliophysics outreach.",TBD,Invited talk,Corona
