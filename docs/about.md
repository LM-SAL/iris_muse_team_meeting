# About the Joint MUSE/IRIS science team meeting

The meeting will be held at the SETI institute in Mountain View, CA, not far (about 20 min car ride) from LMSAL in Palo Alto, CA.
The meeting has no registration fees, and is by invitation only.

**NOTE**: This will be a MUSE and IRIS science team meeting, directly in support to the operations of the missions, and is NOT a conference.
Therefore, for NASA-funded people, this meeting does not need to be entered into the NCTS system for approval.
