# About the Joint MUSE/IRIS science team meeting

## What is the Joint MUSE/IRIS science team meeting?

Our current understanding of the solar chromosphere, transition region, and corona is rapidly evolving, fueled by increasingly advanced simulations of the coupled solar atmosphere and unprecedented high-resolution observations from ground-based (e.g., SST, DKIST) and space-based (e.g., IRIS, Solar Orbiter/EUI) telescopes.

The purpose of this meeting is to advance our knowledge of the dominant processes driving solar dynamics and heating—and to develop next-generation models—it is essential to rigorously compare simulations with observations, focusing on resolving discrepancies between observed and synthetic spectra.

This joint team meeting provides a dynamic forum for critical comparison, highlighting recent breakthroughs, identifying missing physics, and charting paths toward more realistic simulations, with particular attention to IRIS and the upcoming MUSE mission.
