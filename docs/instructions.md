# For presenters

## Talks

The aspect ratio of the projector is 16:9, so be sure to adjust your slide format if you want to make the most of the space. You can present from your own laptop, ideally via HDMI.

## Posters

The poster boards are 124 cm wide and 88 cm tall. They can fit the typical A0 poster only in landscape format, not portrait. If your poster is vertical, it must not exceed 88 cm, otherwise the remaining will be hanging in the air. All posters will be displayed during the entire workshop.
