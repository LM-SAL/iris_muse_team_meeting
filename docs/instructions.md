# Instructions for Presenters

## Talks

Invited talks are 20 minutes long, ideally with 15 minutes for the talk and 5 minutes for questions.
Scene-setting invited talks are 30 minutes long and follow the same pattern as invited talks.

Presenters will use their own laptop and will need to connect to the Meeting Zoom so they can share the presentation.
On-site presenters will connect to two screens via HDMI or USB-C.
The screens must be mirrored.
Their laptops will be connected to Zoom (see below) and share their screens.
They will be muted, "leave computer audio", and turn off the volume.

Remote presenters will present via Zoom, sharing their screens, which will be displayed in the SETI conference room on two screens.

Zoom information is found in the invited Slack channel, if you do not have access please contact the LOC for an invite.

## No Posters

There will be no posters.
