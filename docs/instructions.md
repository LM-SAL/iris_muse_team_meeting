# Instructions for Presenters

## Talks

Talks which are 20 minutes long are 15 minutes for the talk and 5 minutes for questions.
If you go over the 15 minutes, you will get less time for questions.
If you go over 20 minutes, your microphone will be cut, with no questions.

Presenters will use their own laptop and will need to connect to the Meeting Zoom so they can share the presentation.
On-site presenters will connect to two screens via HDMI or USB-C.
The screens must be mirrored.
Their laptops will be connected to Zoom (see below) and share their screens.
They will be muted, "leave computer audio", and turn off the volume.

Remote presenters will present via Zoom, sharing their screens, which will be displayed in the SETI conference room on two screens.
